<h3>Things I Learned:</h3>

<h4><b>More Action, Less Thought</b></h4>
<p>I used to have this bit in high school with my friends about making "theoretical" moves. For example, IF I were to go up to that girl, I would say this. Or playing rock paper scissors, loser has to go up to a girl, but then in reality we would just laugh about what our pick up line might've been. And I've started to realize that it's honestly a pretty detrimental thought process. When action lacks, we play through scenarios in our head, and begin to fantasize in our mind rather than living in reality. Life becomes a show that we watch in our imagination. You feed yourself dopamine by imagining success, future narratives, and rewards, but in reality, nothing got done. Confidence decays, anxiety increases, and results never show. Instead, just do shit. Who cares if you fail, who cares if nothing comes from it, and most of the time something WILL come from it. Through action, we produce truth and generate positive feedback loops.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Better to try and fail, then to not try at all</b></h4>
<p>This lesson has probably had the most effect on my life thus far. In my first semester, I wasn't sure how I felt about Case Western. I had made solid friends, but didn't see myself staying there for four years due to the location, general vibe of the campus and students, and the tiresome focus on pre-med. But, I wasn't confident in my ability to transfer (why? who knows). The people I trusted the most asked why I was hesitant, and I had no idea. Who gives a fuck if it doesn't work out, just send in the applications -- what's the opportunity cost? Wasting time doing nothing else? And I did... and it worked out in the end. Imagine if I thought to myself that it's no use because I'm not going to get in.</p>
<br>
<p>This same philosophy has also been pushing me through the banking recruiting process. This hyper-competitive industry creates a lot of self-doubt through it all, but I'm doing it with the mindset that no matter what happens, I'm learning a lot about myself, and building crucial skills applicable in other fields.</p>

<<h5>Other places I’m utilizing this lesson</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Math major — challenging myself with a difficult course load</li>
  <li>Writing more — and it’s working</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4><b>Don't put others on a pedestal</b></h4>
<p>Conversations should never be nerve-racking. There's no one on this planet who's time is genuinely above me. Although society may not make it seem that way, never let that get to your head. This idea clicked over the last six months as I've been constantly scheduling coffee chats with new people with established careers that I currently seek. At first, I had goosebumps when I got on the phone, scared to say the wrong thing or ask a stupid question, but over time I came to realize that everyone is just a human. Humans who make mistakes, who say stupid things, and who are still learning everyday. Everyone you interact with, has a complex and different life, but my experiences are just as valuable. Since then I've treated my interactions as a way to learn about what people are specialized in, to hear about their experiences and outlooks on life, but also as a way to share my own, and form my opinions through discourse. I've gotten so much value out of this in terms of learning about people and the world through questioning, but have also come to realize this is by far the best way to make friends. Being genuine in the way you approach interactions, and treating conversation as a way to share your own passions and learn about others attracts the same energy you give, helping you find the people that feel right to you.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Relationships are two-sided</b></h4>

<p>I think a problem that I used to have was trying to continue relationships with people that weren't reciprocating the same energy. I would reach out to hang out, send them texts, updates on my life or what I'm working on. But I realized that there were a few people who didn't seem as active or excited to respond, and that's clear signaling. I've gotten a lot better at focusing on the relationships that matter, the friends that respond quickly, enthusiastically, full of excitement and passion to hear about how I'm doing. Those people are worth fighting for. I also realized that I have a pretty detached/avoidant personality, meaning I often put off responding to people, or don't respond, but not because I don't want to, but honestly, I'm not sure why. I need to make sure that I am conscious of those friends that reach out often, and put in more effort on my side. I should never make someone that I care about, feel that they don't matter to me.</p>
<br>
<p>Second note about relationships being two-sided is that I finally realized is sort of the exact opposite, which is that I don't have to put time into relationships that I don't care about. Why should I spend my time and energy around people who don't create value in my life. People who aren't focused on goals that resonate with me, and who spend their time away from areas of growth. It's not my problem, and if something isn't good for me, it is absolutely on me if I don't have the autonomy to step away from it. Surround yourself with the five people you want to be like, and you will grow in that direction.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Quitting "nonchalant-maxxing"</b></h4>
<p>I think I used to have this personality trait where I really felt the need to be "nonchalant". Still, I think part of my personality is very laid back, but I obviously played into it a bit. But, the other side of me is completely the opposite. When I get excited about things, I'm loud and passionate about them, and I need to find that space more often. Getting more excited about conversations, food spots, and the average coffee, because that's who I really am. Unapologetically myself, without the need to seek approval by trying to cultivate this "cool" personality. I like the things that I like because I like them, not because I think that other people will like that I like them -- if that makes sense. I want to give people my good energy, focus on learning from people, and being there to foster new friendships. The first step of de-escalating my "nonchalance" is to be so comfortable in my skin that I can act exactly how my body and mind want to, without filtering anything. It's so much more fun when you build those friendships where you can say out of pocket things, act silly, and also say what's on your mind, but the person listening doesn't judge a second. Few people will understand you like that, and there are only a few people you can act that way around, but by showing your genuine self 100% of the time, those people will find you more often than not.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>A man has two lives</b></h4>
<p>and the second one starts once he realizes he has only one. I'm literally 19, going to school in New York City. I should be thriving, taking advantage of my privilege to be in arguably the best possible situation right now, in the coolest city in the world. I'm in my peak years, stop taking things for granted, keep action going, you're doing great. Focus on yourself, your goals, your health, your relationships, and prosperity will come. This will only happen once, everything I'm experiencing. Every day is a new one, the present is all I have, and the past is only a message of what I've gone through, but has no effect on the decisions I decide to make RIGHT NOW. Do the work and projects and experiments you would be happy to look back on and take lessons from. The second life should start right now.</p>
<br>

<h4><b>Outlook on religion</b></h4>
<p>This has been a pretty big question in my life over the past few years. Do I believe in God, yes. Do I want to follow my religion to the penny, fuck no. Do I resonate with Muslims and Islam in general, absolutely. </p>
<br>
<p>There's a lot of parts I believe in and want to strive to be like, but it goes the other way as well. I'm not totally sure where to go in terms of the next step. Lots of people have recommended to me to start trying to pray more on my own, but I just don't see the appeal of how it will affect my life. I want to try getting back into it, but it's hard at school. I'll try though, and my new perspective is to try and see it as a form of meditation, not this act of worship, and I think that might help me gain more clarity.</p>
<br>
<p>Start reading some Quran in english to get more of a sense of what it's about. I know for a fact it has tons of wisdom, so even putting religion in the dark, and reading it could be a great exercise. But in general, I want to give myself more opportunities and expose myself to more ways to get closer to religion and understand it better. I want to be religious honestly, it's just hard to listen to everything a book tells me to without getting to discover anything on my own. I want to make the template for my life, not get it gift-wrapped and handed to me.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>I yearn to travel</b></h4>
<p>Going to England + Barcelona this year was one of the greatest experiences I've ever had. Being in a completely new place, where no one knows who you are, and all you have is time to explore, what more can one ask for. Getting to surround myself with novel culture, learn from new people, and be separated from routine was something that I can't replicate at home or at school. The freshness of it all was healing, and it made me realize that's how I want to spend my time. Except, I want to do it with even less structure next time. More spontaneity, more interactions with locals, less tourism. This year has taught me that humans and connections are the reason I love life, and I want to put myself in every opportunity to explore the different experiences people have around the world. I want to use my privilege to connect with more people and explore the different opportunities and excitements that the world has to offer.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>What I want for myself:</h4></b>
<p>I want to understand the world on a deeper level. We're all so conditioned to see the worst in people, to be cautious when walking alone at night, to make sure your bags are secure (these are obviously still valid fears, extreme to get the point across). I'm trying to flip my outlook, to step outside that comfort zone and realize that material possessions are an illusion. Reality is people, and friendships, and relationships, and experience. I want to care less about what I have, and focus more on what there is to give. The greatest gift we can give is our authentic selves. I'm going to think a lot more about where I spend my time, and consciously try and put my hand out to more people; not placing myself at the center of the universe. Obviously, prioritizing myself in ways that are important like physical and mental health, but being aware enough step back, and try to understand where people are coming from. Instead of being that guy that honks in traffic, take a second to think about the real problems people have, not me just being tired and wanting to go home.</p>
<br>
<p>I want to detach myself from external pressures, and begin to chase those intrinsic goals. Doing the things that I want for myself, not those that I think would look good for me. There's no need to second guess all my desires, or to ask for external validation. I should have the autonomy and the self-respect to listen to myself, and do the things that I want to do.</p>
<br>

<h4>Goals</h4>

<h5>Tangible</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Internship</li>
  <li>Read 25 short stories / long form essays </li>
  <li>Higher conviction over wake-up times</li>
  <li>Lean out and gain muscle</li>
  <li>Cardio, stretching, flexibility</li>
  <li>Meditation</li>
</ul>

<h5>Intangible</h5>

  <li>Be myself in all scenarios</li>
  <li>More action, less thought</li>

</ul>

</ul>
<br>
<h4><b>Outlook on life:</b></h4>
<p>I'm genuinely still 19, like I'm a kid still realistically. Being too hard on myself at this age. Expectations are important, but when everything is still so new, all I should expect from myself is a best, authentic effort, and good things will follow. </p>
<br>
<p>I think I'm pretty lost in terms of life philosophy and religion right now (my meaning of life), but I think that I have good set of values and beliefs that I'm following. I want to hopefully refine my outlook over the next few years, and figure out what means the most to me, and what I'm truly living for.</p>
<br>

<p>What I hope for, starting my 20s this year:
- Strong career trajectory, healthiest I've ever been, find a partner, create meaning past the superficial and materialistic, travel far and wide, meet thousands of people, try exotic foods, and enjoy the absurdity of my existence.
