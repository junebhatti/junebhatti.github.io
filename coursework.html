<h1>Coursework</h1>

<h3>Important/Loved</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Discrete Math (In Progress) -- will I enjoy proofs? </li>
  <li>Multivariable Calculus (In Progress) -- just took Linear, so excited to think more in the 3D space </li>
  <li>Linear Algebra -- first time I've had to use my imagination in a math course... </li>
  <li>Calculus II -- series tests are sneaky fun...</li>
  <li>Great American Novels -- greatest class I've ever taken, the most I've learned anywhere, with the smartest prof I've ever had. I yearn for another class this good.</li>
  <li>Urdu -- so excited to be learning my cultural language</li>

<h3>More</h3>
  <li>Accounting -- helpful for developing a financial framework... but kind of boring...</li>
  <li>Corporate Finance -- great professor, built solid accounting intuition and a good baseline for when I started recruiting prep</li>
  <li>Microeconomics -- I can see the appeal, but not for me.</li>
  <li>Macroeconomics -- Felt more applicable to everyday life, necessary class, but intro was really simple</li>
  <li>Injustice and Justice -- read some cool stuff, but not too stimulating</li>
  <li>The U.S. Political System -- I learned what gerrymandering is... </li>
  
</ul>
