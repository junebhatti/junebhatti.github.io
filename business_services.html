<h1>Business Services Memo 1.14.2026</h1>

  <h3>1.9.2026</h3>
<h3>Mapping out the Houlihan Lokey Business Services Sector (Los Angeles Office)</h3>

<p>At a high level, business services is the non-core, but essential functions that companies need to operate, and it's often outsourced to specialized providers who can do it better and cheaper. Think payroll processing, janitorial services, or hiring a technician to handle electrical work or install sensors.</p>
<br>
<h4>The Houlihan Lokey Los Angeles office is split into four verticals:</h4>
<ul>
  <p><b>Testing, Inspection, Compliance, and Certification (TICC)</b>
TICC is essentially any B2B services that have to do with regulation and standards inspecting. Think of the product testing before launch, or verifying a company is meeting carbon emissions standards.

Typically a recurring-revenue driven industry, because no matter the economic outlook, these processes always need to be done.
</p>
<br>
<p><b>Facility Services</b>
These are services that produce, maintain, and operate physical assets like HVAC, landscaping services, janitorial, plumbing, pest control.
Often non-discretionary, always need heaters and air conditioning.
Super fragmented, so add-on strategy to scale is huge.
Increasingly becoming more tech-enabled, but as a function to streamline and make more efficient, still involves lots of blue collar.
</p>
<br>
  
<p><b>Engineering and Infrastructure</b>
Infrastructure and engineering design firms, construction managers, industrial service providers, like classic utilities companies (transportation, power, energy, water), and repair services for these utilities companies

Tech enablement here is particularly interesting -- one of the main verticals it's getting pushed in
</p>
<br>
<p><b>Business Process Outsourcing (BPO)</b>
Things like customer service, legal services, back-office, insurance, payroll services

customer services getting overtaken by ai?
</p>
</ul>
<br>
<p>In general, business services is seen to be a fairly asset-light industry. It's historically been reliant on human labor, because most of these services are outsourced, the people hired are experts in engineering, testing, etc, who come to onsite locations to provide their service -- janitorial maintenance, utility maintenance, HVAC maintenance, anyone with a truck and a toolbox -- you get the point.
</p>
<p>It's never the guy that owns the manufacturing plant, but the guy that shows up to inspect xyz, or repair xyz.</p>
<br>
<p>There's no real technological differentiation between companies in business services. They compete for market, customers, reliability, and coverage. It's a natural selection.
The actual work itself isn't based on novel technology implementation and r&d, but being scaling through business growth and beating competitors through market share and customers. 
</p>
<br>
<p>There's specializations that are still important in places like E&I and TICC (spaces where deep technical expertise is needed), but in general there's no defining technologies that make one company way better than the rest -- hence tons of mom & pops, and the extremely fragmented market.
</p>
<h4>Why is PE so interested?</h4>
<ul><p>Business models for business services are practically the blueprint for private equity -- high recurring revenues (contract based or needed annually/quarterly, and non-discretionary), low capex (asset-light), tons of fragmentation. This creates a space where portfolio companies love to make a handful of acquisitions, and grow through scale. Less about acquiring key innovations, and more about stable cash flows add-on acquisitions, and some technology-enablement recently. Adding niche capabilities and expanding geographically can go a long way.
</p>
<p>PE firms look for the companies with the most repeatability, stability, customer bases, scalability, and mission-critical nature.</p>

<p>Not necessarily buying for strategy, but economies of scale; companies with EBITDA margins that can be expanded, efficiencies that can be improved, and add-on potential. And, as of recently, niches that have tech-enablement have become increasingly attractive.
</p>
</ul>
<h4>**Trends:**</h4>
<ul>
<b>Regulatory as a growth driver</b>
  
<p>Policy and regulations act as a built in growth and demand for spaces especially like TICC. If regulations, laws, and policies tighten, companies are forced to hire TICC services at a higher frequency, especially compliance-heavy companies.

An interesting space that's expected to see a lot of growth through regulations and policy is anything that has to do with environmental and sustainability commitments. There's a growing global push for decarbonization, clean energy usage, and emissions control, so expecting to see a lot of testing going on in that space.
</p>

<b>Tech-enablement in a fundamentlaly blue-collar workforce</b>
<p>Obviously business services is heavily blue-collar and physical asset dominated. Workers with tool-kits and trucks inspect elevators, climb windmills, service equipment, and install sensors, and that won't go away -- it can't be done from a desk.
</p>
<br>
<p>However, AI and software are making their impact not as a takeover of the blue-collar physical labor, but as a supplement to optimize workflows of those workers. Think of field services (HVAC monitoring or elevator servicing), instead of going in blind, AI-driven predictive maintenance is making way for more technician efficiency when coming to work. They can get in and get out quicker, as well as have marginal improvements over time, instead of waiting for a system to collapse.
</p>
<br>
<p>These business services companies are developing Maintenance as a Service (MaaS), which relies on IoT and sensor data to inform the best time to do service -- right before an asset fails. Instead of paying for 2 visits a year, companies will pay a subscription fee that updates them constantly throughout the year. Not losing any blue collar jobs here, as physical workers still go in to make changes -- but now there's more efficiency, and less wasted downtime where workers go in to do check-ups, for everything to be working just fine.
</p>
<br>
<p>Sensors on equipment can flag issues and create framework of how they need to be fixed and operated, so when a tech goes on site, they're prepared with the right tools, and know exactly what to do.
</p>
<br>
<p>It's great for top shops that have the capital to invest in these scaled platforms, creating better margins, boosting productivity and efficiency, and having fewer screw ups, but can significantly hurt the smaller players that are stuck in the past on paper and manual scheduling.
</p>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>**Current Industry Detriments/Caveats (speculation)**</h4>
<ul>
<p> Unemployment rising, skilled physical labor/trade workers are declining -- in an era where college education is highly acclaimed. Engineering experts are in their 50s and retiring, not as sexy of an industry to pursue anymore.
Labor driven market, might create higher wages, lose efficiency, and longer delays, which will hurt valuations and increase costs.

Large fragmentation makes pricing power hard, companies always have cheaper alternatives, pushes profits lower in the space overall. Not a lot of differentiation in technology.
</p>
