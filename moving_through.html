<h1>Moving through the world without asking for permission</h1>
  <h5><i>quick thoughts about trying to be more authentic, as a way of attracting the right energy, and feeling proud of the way you navigate life. (one of my intangible resolutions)</i></h5>
<p class="date">January 17, 2026</p>

<p>There was once a time you did what you pleased. Action came without explanation. Where you were free from society, and any urges that ran through your bones had an outlet waiting for them. Your energy flowed to the right places, and you were yourself. <p/>
<br>
<p>As children, we weren't conscious enough to care about others, to try and put on a front. We chased curiosity and were rewarded with novelty and new colors to discover everywhere. We painted our bodies and said what was on our minds, without fear of judgment. We were able to express ourselves fully, and the absence of an audience made us free. </p>
<br>
<p>Times are different now; we hardly act for ourselves because, apparently, everyone around you cares too much about you. We act as though we are being micromanaged, as if we are defined by our perception of others. So we bottle up our creative spirits and authenticity, and put on a face that we think others want to see. We get caught up doing things that we think just might signal success and happiness to others, but forget to act in a way that makes us happy. </p>
<br>
<p>When you lie to yourself and put on a front, you no longer appeal to yourself, but to those around you. A lack of honesty splits your attention from living to managing a performance. The second you start to lie to yourself, trying to be someone or act some way that you are not, you start to perform, and motivation flows to being approved instead of exploration. <i>The reality you live in is no longer yours.</i> Since when did prioritizing others' opinions become so damn important. (It's not!) </p>
<br>
<p>The way to live must be to feel satisfied by the validation that comes internally. When you are the person that you're pushing to be better -- not a version of yourself that you want others to commemorate -- life is liberating. You do your best work on the topics you are most interested in, and you develop real passions that you want to chase. Dreams become satisfied by your hard work and learning experiences, not external validation and material possessions. </p>
<br>
<p>But obviously, society will try and slow you down, those around you -- that chase societally pushed goals  -- might try and criticize you, and tell you off. You'll be misunderstood by the "followers" around you, but the truth is, you'll be understood by yourself, and the energy of those around you who care for your success will be there to celebrate you. That feeling of freedom will begin to radiate off your skin, and you'll attract others around you who feel the same way, and slowly but surely, you won't be ordinary anymore. Let's get back to navigating the world without asking for permission.</p>
