<h1>About Me</h1>
<h4>  "How beautiful it is to realize we can wake up everyday and live, experience, and try." </h4>
<p>This site was built as a sanctuary for my collection of notes, writing, goals, and projects I’m working on.
<br>
<p>I just want to learn. I've been privileged with the time and resources to explore, study, and meet people. My next step is using my and autonomy, willpower, and discipline take it to the next level. Anything and everything is possible.
</p>
<p>I want to spend more time creatively and distanced from the more toxic parts of college life, and spend more time reflecting, writing, reading, and learning from the sources that I consider to be great (famous writers, thinkers, speakers, art, media, etc.)
</p>
<h3>Tangible Goals:</h3>
  <li>Finish recruiting successfully<span class="checkmark">✓</span></li>
  <li>Functionally athletic, aesthetic physique</li>
  <li>Take challenging classes and prove to myself that challenges are spaces to grow -- the mind needs friction</li>
<h3>Intangibles</h3>
  <li>More action, less thought</li>
  <li>Get into challenging discourse with myself via writing, and with people via discussions</li>
  <li>Build self-confidence, and be comfortable exploring the untapped emotion of embarrassment </li>
