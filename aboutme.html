<h1>About Me</h1>
<h6>  "The best time to plant a tree was twenty years ago. The second best time is now"
</h6>
  <br>
<p>This site was built as a sanctuary for my collection of notes, writing, goals, and things I’m working on.
  
<br>
<p>In all honesty, I just want to learn. I've been privileged to have the time and resources to explore, study, and meet people, but feel that I have to have the autonomy, willpower, and discipline take it to the next level
</p>
<p>I want to spend more time creatively and distanced from the more toxic parts of college life, and spend more time reflecting, writing, reading, and learning from the sources that I consider to be great (famous writers, thinkers, speakers, art, media, etc.)
</p>
<br>
<h3>Some of my larger goals right now:</h3>
  <li>Finish recruiting successfully</li>
  <li>Put on more muscle, while getting more functionally athletic</li>
  <li>Get into challenging discourse with myself via writing, and with people via discussions</li>
  <li>Take ridiculously challenging classes that I never thought I could, and prove to myself that I'm capable</li>
  <li>Build self-confidence, and be comfortable exploring the untapped emotion of embarassement</li>
