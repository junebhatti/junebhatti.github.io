<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>This site was built as a sanctuary for my collection of notes, writing, goals, and things I’m working on.
<br>
<p>In all honestly, I just want to learn. I've been privelaged to have the time and resources to explore, study, and meet people, but have felt that I need the autonomy to take it the next level</p>
<p>I want to spend more time creatively and distanced from the more toxic parts of college life, and spend more time reflecting, writing, reading, and learning from the sources that I consider to be great (famous writers, thinkers, speakers, art, media, etc.)</p>
<br>
<h3>Some of my larger goals right now:</h3>
  <p>Finish recruiting successfully</p>
  <p>Put on more muscle, while getting more functionally athletic</p>
  <p>Get into challenging discourse with myself via writing, and with people via discussions</p>
